# Image Processing Web App

## Introduction
This is a Streamlit web application for image processing. It allows users to upload images and apply various image processing filters to them. The application provides a wide range of filters including Laplacian, Gaussian Blur, Adaptive Thresholding, Roberts Operator, Sobel Operator, Prewitt Operator, and many more. Users can visualize the original and processed images along with their histograms. Additionally, they can choose the display mode for the processed image (RGB, Grayscale, Binary) and download the processed image.



## Features
- Upload images in various formats (jpg, jpeg, png, bmp, gif)
- Apply different image processing filters
- Visualize original and processed images along with histograms
- Choose display mode for processed image (RGB, Grayscale, Binary)
- Download the processed image

## Technologies Used
- Streamlit: For building the web application
- OpenCV: For image processing
- NumPy: For numerical computations
- Matplotlib: For plotting histograms
- PIL (Python Imaging Library): For image manipulation
